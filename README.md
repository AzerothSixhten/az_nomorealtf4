# Az_nomorealtf4

Tired of alt-f4 on your role-play server that ruins scenes for you? Fix your worries with az_nomorealtf4, a script using the bansql script by default but modulable for your needs. 

Condition to have for the player to be detected as banned:
- The player is dead by a player
- A disconnection (crash or other problems do not make ban)
- A second player on the server (to execute the client side code since the banned player is disconnected)

This is a small script made without much pretension except to help you, use it at your own will, it was created at the base for a server but it seems that they are too stupid to understand the interest...

Sincerely, Azeroth
